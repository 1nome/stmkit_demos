 *			48 loops = 1 sec
 *			the popping you hear with sines is caused by trimming time to 1-sec intervals
 *			although not powering the dac down souldn't damage it,
 *			you should still do it (not reset before the sound stops playing)
 *
 *			@attention the camera needs to be completely disconnected
